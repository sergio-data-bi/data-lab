## üç∑ Wine Chemical Analysis  
[Project Repository](./Wine%20Chemical%20Analysis)  

**Objective:** Identify key chemical indicators influencing wine quality through statistical analysis.  

**Key Metrics:**  
- Alcohol shows the strongest positive correlation with wine quality (~0.48)  
- Volatile acidity negatively correlates with wine quality (~-0.39)  
- Sulphates positively impact quality, likely due to spoilage prevention  
- Citric acid has a weaker positive correlation  
- Fixed acidity shows a modest positive relationship to quality  

**Tech Stack:**  
- **R** ‚Äì Statistical computing  
- **ggplot2, corrplot** ‚Äì Data visualization  
- **Regression models & clustering** ‚Äì Pattern identification  
- **Wine quality dataset** ‚Äì 1,599 samples, 11 chemical variables
