## üìä Firebase Retention Analysis  
[Project Repository](./Firebase%20Retention%20Analysis)  

**Objective:** Analyze user retention trends from Firebase Analytics event data using **BigQuery**. The project computes **daily and monthly retention rates** to evaluate user engagement and **optimize app performance**.  

**Key Metrics:**  
- **Daily Retention:** Tracks user activity for **30 days** post-signup  
- **Monthly Retention:** Tracks user activity for **12 months** post-signup  
- **First Open Event Detection:** Identifies new users based on their first interaction  
- **Time Zone Adjustment:** Converts event timestamps to **local time**  

**Data Model:**  
The solution processes **raw Firebase event data**, normalizes timestamps, and calculates **cohort-based retention metrics**. Events are extracted from multiple daily tables (`events_YYYYMMDD`) using `_TABLE_SUFFIX` for optimized querying. The analysis uses `event_name`, `event_timestamp` and `user_pseudo_id`.

Key data points include:
- **`event_name`:** Identifies the type of event.  
  - `first_open` is used to determine a user's signup date.
- **`event_timestamp`:** A microsecond timestamp that is normalized to a local DATE.
- **`user_pseudo_id`:** A unique identifier for each user.

**Tech Stack:**  
- **BigQuery SQL** ‚Äì Data querying and transformation  
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** ‚Äì Cloud storage and processing

## üéº Music Analytics
[Project Repository](./Music%20Analytics)  

**Objective:** Transformed raw data from the Million Song Dataset and stored it in a cloud-based environment to analyze user engagement, song popularity, and emerging artist trends.

**Key Metrics:**  
- **1M+ tracks** analyzed across multiple genres
- **48M+ user play records** processed for engagement insights
- **10K+ artists** tracked for trend detection
- Identification of most-streamed songs and top artists
- Analysis of user behavior and consumption trends
- Data preparation for recommendation systems

**Data Model:**  
The solution implements a star schema with one fact table (`songplays`) and four supporting dimensions (`songs`, `artists`, `users`, `time`), all optimized for analytic queries on user behavior and song popularity. Data first lands in staging tables (`staging_events`, `staging_songs`) and is then transformed into the final star schema, supporting scalable analytics on user engagement, trends, and recommendations.

**Tech Stack:**  
- **Python** ‚Äì ETL automation
- **SQL** ‚Äì Querying and structuring data
- **Apache Spark** ‚Äì Large-scale data processing
- **Apache Airflow** ‚Äì Pipeline orchestration and scheduling
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì Local testing database
- **Amazon Redshift** ‚Äì High-performance analytics with clustering
- **Amazon S3** ‚Äì Scalable Cloud data storage

## üç∑ Wine Chemical Analysis  
[Project Repository](./Wine%20Chemical%20Analysis)  
**Objective:** Identify key chemical indicators influencing wine quality through statistical analysis.  
**Key Metrics:**  
- Alcohol shows the strongest positive correlation with wine quality (~0.48)  
- Volatile acidity negatively correlates with wine quality (~-0.39)  
- Sulphates positively impact quality, likely due to spoilage prevention  
- Citric acid has a weaker positive correlation  
- Fixed acidity shows a modest positive relationship to quality  
**Tech Stack:**  
- **R** ‚Äì Statistical computing  
- **ggplot2, corrplot** ‚Äì Data visualization  
- **Regression models & clustering** ‚Äì Pattern identification  
- **Wine quality dataset** ‚Äì 1,599 samples, 11 chemical variables
